    <!-- Details the problem that I will be addressing with my app -->
    <section>
        <h2>Problem Description</h2>
        <p>The general topic of my project will be a data browsing app that will focus on food banks in Seattle, WA. In the crisis of a pandemic, food security has been a high priority as people are facing financial problems that could prevent them from buying food. Recognizing this issue, I want to create a platform that allow Seattle citizens to view food banks that are available. By viewing food banks, users will obtain pertinent information such as a short but detailed description, address, a website link, etc. The goal of this app is to communicate food bank resources that users are able to access to fulfill food needs and/or locations to donate.<br />
        <br />
        Current information technology problems that persist in this space is the lack of new technology to communicate the data pertaining to food banks. For example, each food bank location has their specific website that users are able to access. However, there are very few platforms available that conveniently displays all food banks within an area. With that being said, there have been existing attempts made by Seattle Food Committee and Plentiful to address this issue. Seattle Food Committee created a map that finds the nearest food banks in Seattle, whereas Plentiful provide resources to help food banks operate more efficiently. I plan on improving upon these existing apps by providing a more straightforward platform that allows my audience (residents in Seattle and nearby cities) to conveniently and easily obtain information regarding food banks in Seattle.

        <h2>Proposed Application</h2>
        <p>
            The users of my application are individuals, who face food security problems, seek to donate to food banks, and lives in Seattle or nearby cities. With my data browsing app, users will be able to view important information regarding food banks in Seattle. This includes the name of the food bank, an image of the location, a description, address, phone number, open or closed status, hours of operation, a list of instructions on how to receive/donate food, and a website link for more information regarding the food bank.<br />
            <br />
            For my app, the kind of interactions that I plan to provide is a filtering system that features a search bar, tags, sorting, and viewing by regions to explore the food banks available in Seattle. Additionally, food banks will be displayed in organized squares that will have an image and names that accompany it. Users will then be able to click on the square that represents the food bank to view its details (the kind of information I specified earlier). Within its details, I will include website links and google maps links for each food bank. The website link will provide the user the ability to click on it, which will send the user to the respective food bank website to view more information. Whereas, the google maps link will provide users with the directions to the location. Furthermore, I will add clickable links to a contact us and about pages to allow users to contact me for any questions they have and to learn about the app and its goals.<br />
            <br />
            Lastly, this app will be able to help resolve the issue of food security in Seattle by providing a platform for residents to view food banks that are available. The current situation of the COVID-19 pandemic is worrisome, especially those facing financial problems and lack the resources for food. With my app, I will be able to assist those in need by laying out the essential information to access a food bank to receive or donate food. My goal is to prioritize my users and deliver a seamless experience that will supply the necessary information at hand without having my users conduct further research to learn about the food banks available in Seattle.<br />
